## Todo
- Unit tests
- Improve Readme file
- DB
- Your project is uploaded to GitHub (code not zipped) and polished.
- Your project has a good Readme.
- You follow basic Python naming conventions and don't commit files the users don't need (e.g. pycache, use a .gitignore if needed).
- Your project is modular and consists of several, logically split files that make it easy for users to understand how your app works.
- You have some basic code comments.
- Your analytics module is complete, as defined in the portfolio guidelines.
- Your streak calculation respects the habit's periodicity.
- You have 4 weeks worth of predefined habit data (time-series data) that you can use in unit tests to verify your streak calculations.
- You have a good suite of unit tests covering a) habit creation, editing and deletion and b) tests for each functionality in the analytics module.
